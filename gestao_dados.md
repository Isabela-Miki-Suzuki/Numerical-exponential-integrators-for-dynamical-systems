# Description of how the data management plan is being followed and any changes

The project is following what was initially proposed, with the student doing an in-depth study of the main exponential methods, such as exponential Euler, exponential time differencing methods and exponential time differencing methods with Runge-Kutta time stepping.

Small changes were the most emphasized paper [1], which shared a lot of attention with other papers like [6] and [7].

Until the end of the period of validity, it is expected that the analyzes in methods of the Runge-Kutta type will be completed and that the methods studied will be applied to problems of dynamical systems.
