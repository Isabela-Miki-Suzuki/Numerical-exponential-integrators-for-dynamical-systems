# 1. Summary of the proposed project

This is a scientific initiation project that proposes the deep study of some of the main methods
of exponential integration for problems in dynamic systems, with emphasis on the paper {cite:ps}`Hochbruck2010`.
Here, the undergraduate will study the construction, analysis, implementation and application
of them and at the end, it is expected that she is familiar with modern techniques of numerical
methods.

**Keywords:** exponential integrator, numerical methods, dynamical systems.
